**Number Plate Recognition System**

This project implements an automatic number plate recognition system using Python libraries like OpenCV, easyocr, and tkinter.

**Features**

* User-friendly GUI for image upload.
* Number plate detection within the uploaded image.
* Character recognition (alphanumeric) from the detected number plate.
* Integration with a car details database (`Car_details.py`) for retrieving information based on the recognized plate number.
* Bill generation displaying the retrieved car details.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
* easyocr (`pip install easyocr`)
* Pillow (PIL Fork) (`pip install Pillow`)
* tkinter (included in standard Python installation)

**How to Use**

1. **Clone or Download the Code:** Obtain the project files either by cloning the repository or downloading them directly.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Use `pip` to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python easyocr Pillow
   ```
3. **Car Details Database:** Ensure the `Car_details.py` file exists and contains a dictionary where car plate numbers are keys and car details (like owner name, model, etc.) are values.
4. **Run the Script:** Execute the code using `python number_plate_recognition.py`.

**Additional Notes**

* The code assumes the `Car_details.py` file is located in the same directory as the main script (`number_plate_recognition.py`).
* Feel free to modify the code to customize the behavior or appearance of the application.

I hope this readme.md file provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the project!
